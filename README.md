Introducing the Plinkon-Hub!
----------------------------
This is a Roblox hub that has a bunch of
scripts and quality of life features.
With this script, you can develop other scripts
easier with the implemented DEX and Simple Spy.
You can also have fun and try out the different 
scripts that I have added into this project.
This script does use A KEY, but it is easy
to get so don't worry. I will probably update
this script hub weekly, although I have lots 
of work to do besides this. The Plinkon-Hub
is something I have made in my freetime and I
might or might not continue it.

it might work.
